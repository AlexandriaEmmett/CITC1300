            <h2 class="heading_style">Steven Universe: Beach City</h2>
            <p>The setting of Steven Universe is primarily centered around Beach City, a small, coastal town located along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. This quaint, peaceful town features a variety of colorful, unique characters and places that contribute to the series' charm. The coastal environment and the natural beauty surrounding Beach City play an important role in the series, providing a serene and sometimes mysterious atmosphere. There are forests, caverns, and hidden gems scattered throughout the landscape, offering both a sense of adventure and a place for quiet reflection. The setting in Steven Universe is as much a character in itself as the people and Gems. It’s a space where magic and the ordinary coexist, helping to blend the fantastical elements of the show with its more grounded, emotional moments. The environment supports the series' themes of growth, exploration, and the importance of community, making Beach City feel like home to Steven and the audience.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style">The Gem Homeworld</h2>
            <p>The Gem Homeworld in Steven Universe is a mysterious, technologically advanced planet that serves as the central hub for the Gem race. It is vastly different from Earth, characterized by its cold, industrial landscape, and rigid, hierarchical society. The Homeworld is depicted as a highly organized, sterile environment where Gems are created and assigned specific roles based on their type, each with distinct abilities and functions. It’s a place where emotion and individuality are suppressed in favor of conformity and order.</p>
